# Round-144 R12 Loop-8 Price Validation Plan

## Method

1. Assign stage dates from source evidence only.
2. Store stage-date close prices from official price data.
3. Calculate MFE_30D / 90D / 180D / 1Y / 2Y.
4. Calculate MAE_30D / 90D / 180D / 1Y.
5. Compare price paths with farm income, equipment sales, commodity prices, disease events, recurring revenue, CAC, churn, regulatory scope, and FCF.

## Alignment Labels

- `smart_farm_unit_economics_aligned`: orders, utilization, energy cost, and FCF move together.
- `vertical_farming_4c`: shutdown, Chapter 11, premium-pricing failure, or CAPEX burden breaks the case.
- `agri_machinery_tech_but_cycle_watch`: technology exists, but farm income, financing, and equipment demand cap the case.
- `agri_machinery_demand_4c`: farm income, crop price, financing cost, and dealer inventory break the equipment-cycle case.
- `agri_machinery_software_lockin_regulatory_watch`: software attach exists, but right-to-repair and dealer-monopoly risk must be priced.
- `right_to_repair_expansion_4c`: construction-equipment repair litigation expands the software-lock-in RedTeam gate.
- `agri_input_licensed_ip_success`: seed/IP licensing and crop-science EBITDA can help only if litigation and farmer margin risk are controlled.
- `fertilizer_cycle_with_input_risk`: potash or fertilizer demand is cycle credit, not Green, until farmer margin and FCF prove durability.
- `fertilizer_potash_phosphate_option_watch`: phosphate optionality remains Watch/Yellow until volume, farmer ROI, asset scope, and FCF are confirmed.
- `animal_health_event_to_contract`: disease event turns into vaccine approval, stockpile, and repeated use.
- `livestock_cyclical_success`: price spike generated profit, but structural durability is weak.
- `livestock_regulatory_4c`: price investigations, DOJ risk, disease normalization, or consumer backlash cap livestock price spikes.
- `edtech_ai_monetization_failed`: AI education features hurt the thesis if bookings, paid conversion, monetization, or margin breaks.
- `education_ai_disruption_4c`: AI replaces the core service or weakens traffic, subscribers, bookings, and revenue.
- `edtech_search_disintermediation_4c`: AI search removes organic distribution and weakens traffic or paid conversion.
- `online_education_opm_hard_4c`: debt, student ROI, partner concentration, or bankruptcy breaks online OPM.
- `rental_recurring_success`: rental accounts, churn, care-service revenue, and FCF are confirmed.
- `kiosk_operational_failure`: self-checkout or kiosk rollout retreats because theft, customer friction, or workload rises.
- `self_checkout_local_regulation_watch`: item limits, staff requirements, or local ordinances cap the kiosk productivity story.
- `regulated_consumer_approval_stage2`: FDA/DEA approval can create Stage 2, but scope and public-health gates remain.
- `nicotine_alternative_regulatory_watch`: enforcement easing or nicotine-pouch growth still needs authorization scope and youth-risk checks.
- `nicotine_pouch_youth_safety_gate`: youth addiction, high nicotine content, flavor, advertising, or influencer risk blocks positive nicotine-pouch scoring.
- `cannabis_rescheduling_limited_stage2`: partial rescheduling is policy credit only after license scope, commercial channel, and tax effect are verified.
- `disclosure_confidence_capped`: R12 headlines stay capped until unit economics, regulatory scope, and parser confidence are verified.
