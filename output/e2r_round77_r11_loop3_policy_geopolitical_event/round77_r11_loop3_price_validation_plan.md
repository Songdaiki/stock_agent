# Round-77 R11 Loop-3 Price Validation Plan

## Method

1. Assign stage dates from source evidence only.
2. Store Stage 1 and Stage 2 event-date close prices from official price data.
3. Calculate MFE_5D / 20D / 60D / 90D / 180D and matching MAE windows.
4. Calculate peak_price and drawdown_after_peak.
5. Compare price moves with actual contracts, budgets, government orders, financing, construction starts, revenue, and EPS evidence.
6. If evidence is missing, classify as `price_moved_without_evidence`, `event_premium`, or `policy_relief_only`.

## Alignment Labels

- `event_to_contract_stockpile_candidate`: event demand is backed by a government stockpile contract, but still needs recurrence and margin checks.
- `funded_geopolitical_infra_candidate`: financing exists; company-level contract and margin proof still decide scoring.
- `event_to_infra_crossover_candidate`: climate/disaster demand crossed into grid, VPP, ESS, cooling, or rebuild infrastructure.
- `price_moved_without_evidence`: science, policy, or disaster theme moved price before technical/customer/revenue evidence.
- `speculative_science_failure`: replication failure or impurity explanation breaks the thesis.
- `one_off_diagnostic_demand_normalized`: diagnostics revenue fell after temporary event demand normalized.
- `policy_market_shock_event`: policy comments changed market risk premium; this is RedTeam evidence unless company EPS/FCF impact is quantified.
