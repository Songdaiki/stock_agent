## What Not To Change

- Do not apply these R11 Loop-10 v10 weights to production scoring yet.
- Do not treat policy headlines, war/reconstruction slogans, disasters, outbreaks, local policy, or preprints as Green evidence by itself.
- Do not invent contracts, government orders, budgets, dose amounts, project financing, construction starts, revenue, guidance, or price-path fields.
- Do not lower Stage 3-Green for event recall. Green requires source-backed contract, budget, revenue, recurring demand, or EPS/FCF conversion.
- Treat replication failure, facility dismantling, military escalation, demand normalization, purchase end, budget delay, and no-customer science themes as RedTeam evidence.
