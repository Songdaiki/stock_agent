## Core Rule

R10 is a credit, cash-flow, occupancy, AFFO, power/water, tenant, and volume round before it is a backlog, dividend, AI data-center, or reconstruction round.
Green requires source-backed PF repair, cash conversion, NOI/AFFO, dividend coverage, tenant lease, power/water access, volume, OPM, or FCF evidence.

Example: a data-center REIT IPO can be useful Stage 1 evidence. It is not the same as acquired assets, binding tenant lease, NOI/AFFO, power and water access, and dividend coverage.

## R10 v8 Base Score Axes

These axes are calibration material only. They document how Round 142 weighs cash-flow conversion before real-estate, data-center, or building-material headlines can become higher-conviction evidence.
- eps_fcf_affo_noi_conversion: 24
- asset_tenant_contract_pf_visibility: 20
- power_water_permitting_local_acceptance: 16
- cost_price_volume_mna_synergy: 14
- leverage_capex_affo_integrity_disclosure: 12
- market_mispricing_rerating_gap: 8
- valuation_room_4b_margin: 6

## R10 v8 Stage Caps

These caps make the rule explicit: a headline can enter radar, but it cannot become high-conviction evidence until cash-flow, tenant, asset, power/water, volume, leverage, and price-path checks are satisfied.
- stage1_headline_cap: 45
- stage2_cashflow_visibility_cap: 70
- stage3_cross_evidence_gate: requires_score_above_70_and_cross_evidence
- stage4b_4c_real_asset_breaks: monitor_or_break
