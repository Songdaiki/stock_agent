## Interpretation

- R1 Loop 9 narrows order/backlog candidates after the R13 Loop-8 RedTeam pass.
- Order size is not enough. Green needs contract amount, duration, counterparty, delivery schedule, margin, OP/EPS revision, FCF conversion, and price-path alignment.
- Loop 9 makes score-to-stage-to-price validation explicit: Stage 2 contracts are not Stage 3 until OP/EPS/FCF, margin, and price path line up.
- Loop 9 base score weights are EPS/FCF 25, visibility 22, bottleneck/pricing 18, capital discipline 10, mispricing 9, valuation room 7, disclosure confidence 9.
- Loop 9 keeps EHV transformer export, backlog-to-FCF conversion, grid-flexibility context, nuclear restart approval gates, and data-center power/water gates.
- Example: transformer shortage is strong, but low-margin long-term contracts or data-center project delay can still block Green.
- Example: GE Vernova is score-to-stage-to-price aligned, but its large rerating requires 4B-watch.
- Example: LS Electric 525kV and Hyundai Rotem Morocco rail are Stage 2 until price, margin, OP/EPS, and FCF are backfilled.
- Example: defense backlog can be strong, but share issuance and unclear overseas CAPEX are capital-allocation shocks.
- Example: OpenDART list-only contract evidence is capped until amount, counterparty, duration, and margin detail are checked.
- Example: existing nuclear PPA and SMR policy are separated because cashflow visibility is different.
