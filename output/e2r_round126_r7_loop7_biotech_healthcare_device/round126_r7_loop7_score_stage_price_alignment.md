# Round-126 R7 Loop-7 Score / Stage / Price Alignment

Round 126 checks whether R7 healthcare evidence is actually moving from science, approval, and TAM into commercialization, recurring revenue, and price-path confirmation.
This is calibration material only; it does not change production scoring.

| case | score-stage view | price-path signal | verdict | normalization adjustment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `samsung_biologics_gsk_us_facility_case` | Stage 2 | strategic US CDMO site and 60,000L capacity, but announcement price path lagged the market | capacity improves visibility but is not Stage 3 without customers, utilization, tech transfer, OPM, and FCF | raise CDMO visibility; cap EPS/FCF until contracted utilization and margin conversion are visible |
| `intuitive_surgical_q1_2026_procedure_growth_case` | Stage 2->3 | procedure growth, instruments/accessories revenue, guidance raise, and positive price reaction aligned | surgical robot installed-base recurring consumables are the cleanest R7 structural medtech pattern | raise procedure growth, installed base, consumables, and OPM/FCF conversion weight |
| `lilly_foundayo_fda_approval_case` | Stage 2 | FDA approval and launch price aligned with positive price reaction | approval was correctly captured, but Stage 3 waits for scripts, insurance, gross-to-net, refill, and OP/EPS | add oral GLP-1 approval target; keep prescription and reimbursement gate strict |
| `lilly_foundayo_switch_maintenance_case` | Stage 2 reinforcement | maintenance data supports injection-to-pill switch durability, but commercial proof is still missing | maintenance therapy strengthens visibility without replacing scripts and coverage | add refill/adherence field; cap Stage 3 until coverage, price, scripts, and OP/EPS are visible |
| `boehringer_goodrx_humira_biosimilar_case` | Stage 2 | PBM/cash-pay access and deep discount improved access, but uptake remained slow | biosimilar access without prescription switch is not Green | raise PBM/formulary and prescription conversion weight; keep discount-only cap |
| `lunit_dbt_subgroup_validation_case` | Stage 1~2 | large external validation showed AUC/recall but subgroup weaknesses remained | medical AI evidence is research-quality until deployment, reimbursement, workflow, and liability pass | add subgroup generalization overlay and keep paper/AUC-only cap |
| `novo_glp1_price_pressure_case` | 4B->4C | price war, competition, copycat pressure, and sales/profit warning matched sharp drawdown | GLP-1 TAM does not override price/gross-to-net and competition risk | raise GLP-1 price-war and gross-to-net RedTeam weight |
| `hims_branded_glp1_pivot_loss_case` | 4C-watch | branded pivot cost, legal/restructuring cost, revenue recognition, and loss matched drawdown | telehealth GLP-1 is channel economics and compliance, not drug TAM | raise CAC, legal cost, revenue recognition, and compliance gates |
| `bluebird_gene_therapy_cash_crunch_case` | hard 4C | approved gene therapies still failed through slow uptake, cash crunch, and discounted take-private | approval without patient uptake and reimbursement is a commercialization failure | raise patient uptake, reimbursement, cash runway, and going-concern gates |
| `charles_river_cro_funding_crunch_case` | 4C-watch | CRO forecast cut and biotech funding crunch matched negative price reaction | CRO recurring service is exposed to customer funding cycle | add explicit CRO funding-cycle overlay and customer R&D budget gate |
| `teladoc_betterhelp_impairment_case` | hard 4C | impairment, CAC pressure, forecast withdrawal, and record-low price path matched RedTeam | telehealth user demand is not enough without unit economics and contract durability | increase DTC telehealth CAC/impairment/forecast-withdrawal penalty |
| `amgen_samsung_bioepis_biosimilar_litigation_case` | 4C-watch | patent litigation can delay biosimilar launch and damage economics | filing or approval does not remove launch-timing risk | make patent litigation a mandatory biosimilar RedTeam field |
| `botox_counterfeit_fda_warning_case` | 4C-watch | counterfeit/unapproved injectable and injury reports triggered safety warnings | repeat aesthetic demand is capped by licensed channel and safety | keep device safety/counterfeit as hard gate for aesthetic repeat-demand stories |

## What This Means

- Approval, AUC, TAM, and capacity can open Stage 1/2, but Stage 3 waits for scripts, reimbursement, repeat revenue, utilization, OPM/FCF, and price-path alignment.
- RedTeam overlays such as GLP-1 price war, compounded-drug crackdown, cash crunch, patent litigation, subgroup AI failure, and device safety can block or break promotion.
