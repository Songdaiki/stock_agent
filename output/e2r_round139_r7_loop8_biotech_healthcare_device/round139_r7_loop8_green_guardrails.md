## What Not To Change

- Do not apply R7 Loop-8 v8.0 weights to production scoring yet.
- Do not treat FDA/EMA approval, clinical success, AI model AUC, external-validation paper, pilot, user growth, or disease-event demand as Green evidence by itself.
- Do not invent prescription volume, PBM/insurance coverage, reimbursement, capacity utilization, patient uptake, hospital adoption, external validation, procedure volume, consumable revenue, cash runway, CAC, churn, legal costs, restructuring costs, or stage prices.
- Green requires commercialization, reimbursement, recurring revenue, FCF conversion, contracted utilization, or repeated procedure/consumable evidence.
- Treat slow uptake, cash crunch, dilution, take-private, forecast cut, FDA crackdown, DOJ referral, unapproved copycat, biosimilar patent litigation, privacy breach, impairment, counterfeit product, safety issue, price control, and one-off diagnostic normalization as RedTeam evidence.
