## What Not To Change

- Do not apply R4 Loop-9 v9.0 weights to production scoring yet.
- Do not treat commodity price, spread recovery, tender offers, policy headlines, or science themes as Green evidence by themselves.
- Do not invent spread, offtake, price floor, production capacity, AISC, cash cost, FCF, capital return, project FID, sulfur input cost, or stage prices.
- Treat oversupply, mine restart, dividend cut, inventory distortion, event premium, capital raise, dilution, sulfur/HPAL input-cost squeeze, and no commercialization as RedTeam fields.
