## What Not To Change

- Do not apply R5 Loop-7 v7.0 weights to production scoring yet.
- Do not treat viral demand, channel entry, GMV, user count, store count, or appliance hardware sales as Green evidence by themselves.
- Do not invent export growth, sell-through, reorder, inventory, receivables, churn, tariff rate, FCF, or stage prices.
- Treat food recall, country sales ban, data breach, supplier regulation, payment delay, channel stuffing, IP litigation, product safety, and tariff/import damage as RedTeam fields.
