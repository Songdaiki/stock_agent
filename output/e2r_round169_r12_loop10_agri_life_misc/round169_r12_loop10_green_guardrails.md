## What Not To Change

- Do not apply these R12 Loop-10 v10 weights to production scoring yet.
- Do not treat essential demand, policy support, weather, disease, grain prices, education users, rental accounts, or FDA/DEA headlines as Green evidence by itself.
- Do not invent unit economics, government orders, completion rates, CAC, churn, regulatory scope, software attach rate, or price-path fields.
- Do not lower Stage 3-Green for R12 recall. Green requires repeat contracts, repeat revenue, unit economics, regulatory stability, and FCF conversion.
- Treat Chapter 11, AI substitution, bookings misses, dividend suspension, retailer retreat, theft/shrink, public-health reversal, commodity normalization, and right-to-repair risk as RedTeam evidence.
