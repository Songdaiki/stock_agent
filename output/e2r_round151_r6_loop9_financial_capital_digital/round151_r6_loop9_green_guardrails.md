## What Not To Change

- Do not apply R6 Loop-9 v9.0 weights to production scoring yet.
- Do not treat low PBR, value-up index inclusion, buyback announcement, user count, IPO optionality, exchange stake, exchange market share, or stablecoin law news as Green evidence by themselves.
- Do not equate buyback with cancellation.
- Do not invent ROE, CET1, K-ICS, CSM, cancellation amount, cancellation completion, take rate, FCF, reserve ratio, stablecoin volume, equity-method income, collaboration revenue, exchange security status, or stage prices.
- Treat governance execution failure, tax policy shock, stablecoin convertibility failure, algorithmic stablecoin failure, and exchange security incidents as RedTeam overlays.
