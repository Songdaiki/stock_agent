## What Not To Change

- Do not apply R2 Loop-5 v5.0 weights to production scoring yet.
- Do not treat all AI beneficiaries as one archetype.
- Do not make CXL, glass substrate, neuromorphic, or AI chip related-stock keywords Green evidence without revenue.
- Do not invent contract value, customer name, duration, prepayment, HBM yield, margin, stage price, or FCF.
- Treat accounting trust break as hard 4C; treat AI CAPEX crowding as a 4B overlay, not a positive score.
