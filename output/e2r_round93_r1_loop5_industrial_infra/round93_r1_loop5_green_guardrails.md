## What Not To Change

- Do not apply R1 Loop-5 v5.0 weights to production scoring yet.
- Do not lower Stage 3-Green thresholds because R1 is Green-capable.
- Do not treat MOU, policy expectation, prototype, or project headline as Green evidence.
- Do not invent contract values, contract dates, counterparties, delivery schedules, margins, or stage prices.
- Treat project delay, capital-allocation shock, low-margin backlog, MRO option-only, and SMR policy false Green as strong penalties.
- Apply disclosure confidence caps when contract amount, counterparty, period, or margin detail is missing.
