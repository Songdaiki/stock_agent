"""Round-160 R2 Loop-10 AI, semiconductor, and electronics pack.

Round 160 returns to R2 after the R1 Loop-10 pass. It separates HBM leaders,
HBM LTA/prepayment, HBM catch-up execution, memory supply reallocation,
AI storage NAND, AI equipment CAPEX, custom AI ASICs, advanced packaging,
AI networking, photonics, server ODM, neocloud, cooling, AI accelerator
pure-plays, circular financing, and accounting trust overlays.

The source round enumerates 21 primary Loop-10 targets. This pack keeps those
source targets plus six previously separated helper overlays/adjacent R2
targets so that tests and reports do not collapse AI beneficiaries into one
bucket.

This module is calibration/report material only. Production feature
engineering, scoring, staging, and RedTeam code must not import it.
