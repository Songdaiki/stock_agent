"""Round-149 R4 Loop-9 materials, spread, and strategic-resources pack.

Round 149 turns R4 into a score-stage-price alignment layer for chemicals,
refining, metals, rare earths, copper, lithium, gold miners, Korea Zinc-style
event premiums, packaging, and speculative material themes. It separates
commodity price moves from structural EPS/FCF rerating: price floor, offtake,
government investment, realized price, AISC, production volume, cash cost, FCF,
capital return, dilution, governance events, and processing input costs decide
the stage.

Simple example: copper record highs are useful Stage 1/2 macro evidence. They
are not company-level Stage 3-Green unless production volume, cash cost, FCF,
capital return, and processing input costs are visible as-of the case date.

This module is calibration/report material only: production feature
engineering, scoring, staging, and RedTeam code must not import it.
