"""Round-139 R7 Loop-8 biotech, healthcare, and medical-device pack.

Round 139 tightens the R7 healthcare pack. It separates approvals, clinical
wins, AI papers, user growth, large TAM stories, and capacity narratives from
actual commercialization evidence: prescriptions, reimbursement, revenue
conversion, capacity utilization, recurring procedures, consumables, OPM, FCF,
cash runway, and device safety.

This module is calibration/report material only. Production feature
engineering, scoring, staging, and RedTeam code must not import it.
