"""Round-151 R6 Loop-9 financial, capital-allocation, and digital-finance pack.

Round 151 separates cheapness from discount removal. Low PBR, value-up policy,
buyback plans, IPO hopes, stablecoin legislation, and exchange stakes are
routing evidence. Stage 3 needs ROE/PBR band change, repeated return execution,
credit-cost stability, capital ratios, regulated digital-finance economics, and
observed price-path alignment.

Simple example: `저PBR 은행주` is Stage 1. `ROE 개선 + CET1 안정 + 실제 소각
+ credit cost 안정 + PBR band 변화` can support Stage 2/3 review.

This module is calibration/report material only. Production feature
engineering, scoring, staging, and RedTeam code must not import it.
