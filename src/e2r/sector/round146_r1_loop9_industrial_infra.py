"""Round-146 R1 Loop-9 industrial orders and infrastructure pack.

Round 146 returns to R1 after the R13 Loop-8 RedTeam pass. It tightens the
industrial/order/infrastructure sector around backlog-to-FCF conversion,
contract detail, margin evidence, capital-allocation shock, approval gates,
and price-path validation.

This module is calibration/report material only. Production feature
engineering, scoring, staging, and RedTeam code must not import it.
