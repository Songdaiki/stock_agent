"""Round-150 R5 Loop-9 consumer, retail, and brand calibration pack.

Round 150 tightens R5 by separating consumer buzz from EPS/FCF bodyweight
change. Export growth, ASP, offline channels, TikTok/Amazon/Ulta sales, and
GMV are routing evidence. Stage 3 needs sell-through, reorder, OPM/FCF,
inventory/receivables quality, trust/security, tariff/import, legal/safety,
and observed price-path alignment.

Simple example: `Ulta 입점` is useful Stage 2 evidence. It is not Green if
sell-through, reorder, OPM, inventory, and receivables are unknown.

This module is calibration/report material only: production feature
engineering, scoring, staging, and RedTeam code must not import it.
