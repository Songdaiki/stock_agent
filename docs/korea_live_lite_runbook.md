# Korea Live-Lite Runbook

## Purpose

Korea live-lite mode is the controlled pilot between fixture-only research and a full live data system.

It uses free sources with strict budgets:

```text
official/free source scan
-> cheap candidates
-> targeted web research
-> morning brief
```

It is not designed to deep-search every KOSPI/KOSDAQ company.

## Fixture Mode

Fixture mode is the default and requires no credentials.

Example:

```python
from datetime import date
from e2r.pipeline.korea_live_lite import KoreaLiveLiteConfig, KoreaLiveLiteRunner

result = KoreaLiveLiteRunner().run(
    KoreaLiveLiteConfig(as_of_date=date(2024, 5, 21))
)
```

The default fixture sources point to:

```text
data/raw/korea_cheap_scan/
```

This is useful for local development and CI because no network call is made.

## Live-Lite Mode

Live-lite mode can be enabled explicitly:

```python
result = KoreaLiveLiteRunner().run(
    KoreaLiveLiteConfig(
        as_of_date=date.today(),
        fixture_mode=False,
        live_enabled=True,
    )
)
```

Required environment variables for live mode:

```text
OPENDART_API_KEY
KRX_OPENAPI_KEY or DATA_GO_KR_SERVICE_KEY
NAVER_CLIENT_ID
NAVER_CLIENT_SECRET
```

If credentials are missing, the runner falls back to fixture mode and records the missing names in:

```text
output/korea_live_lite/YYYY-MM-DD_run_log.json
```

## Source Modes

`run_log.json` separates source state explicitly:

```text
fixture
request_only
live_executed
fallback
```

Meaning:

- `fixture`: local CSV/JSON/TXT fixtures were used.
- `request_only`: request metadata was built, but live execution is not implemented or not enabled for that source.
- `live_executed`: a controlled HTTP request was executed or served from live cache.
- `fallback`: live mode was requested but the runner used fixture/fallback data because credentials were missing or the live request failed.

Simple example:

```json
{
  "source_modes": {
    "opendart": "live_executed",
    "krx": "request_only",
    "data_go_kr": "live_executed",
    "naver_search": "live_executed"
  }
}
```

OpenDART date-range disclosure search, Naver Search, and data.go.kr FSC listed-item/stock-price collection have live execution paths. KRX remains request-only until its endpoint executor is wired in.

`run_log.json` also records:

```text
live_requests_executed
live_requests_failed
cache_hits
cache_writes
fallback_reasons
request_only_sources
```

API keys are not written into the run log.

## Default Budgets

```text
max_opendart_calls_per_day = 1000
max_krx_calls_per_day = 500
max_data_go_kr_calls_per_day = 500
max_naver_search_calls_per_day = 2000
max_symbols_for_event_search = 200
max_symbols_for_deep_research = 30
```

Example with a smaller pilot:

```python
from e2r.pipeline.korea_live_lite import KoreaLiveLiteBudget, KoreaLiveLiteConfig

config = KoreaLiveLiteConfig(
    as_of_date=date.today(),
    budget=KoreaLiveLiteBudget(
        max_opendart_calls_per_day=100,
        max_krx_calls_per_day=100,
        max_data_go_kr_calls_per_day=100,
        max_naver_search_calls_per_day=300,
        max_symbols_for_event_search=30,
        max_symbols_for_deep_research=5,
    ),
)
```

## Pipeline Steps

1. Load the Korea universe from KRX/data.go.kr fixture or live-backed connectors.
2. Pull price bars under the KRX/data.go.kr call budget.
3. Pull same-day/prior-day OpenDART disclosures by date range, not symbol-by-symbol.
4. Run `KoreaCheapScanner`.
5. Select only `event_search` and `deep_research` candidates.
6. Run `FreeWebResearchRunner` under Naver/search query budgets.
7. Generate a Korean morning brief.
8. Write JSON and Markdown outputs.

## data.go.kr Price And Universe Live Execution

When `fixture_mode=False`, `live_enabled=True`, and `DATA_GO_KR_SERVICE_KEY` is present, the runner can execute the free Financial Services Commission data.go.kr path for:

```text
listed items -> Instrument
stock prices -> PriceBar
```

It uses bulk/date/page requests instead of one request per symbol.

Good:

```text
call listed item page 1
call stock price page 1 for the date window
normalize rows locally by symbol
```

Bad:

```text
for each listed company:
    call daily stock price API
```

The first safe live path currently uses:

```text
GetKrxListedInfoService/getItemInfo
GetStockSecuritiesInfoService/getStockPriceInfo
```

Raw JSON is cached under:

```text
data/cache/data_go_kr/YYYY-MM-DD/
```

If the data.go.kr call fails, the run log records:

```text
source_modes.data_go_kr = fallback
fallback_reasons.data_go_kr = data_go_kr_listed_items_failed
```

If the daily data.go.kr budget is too small to fetch both universe and price data, the runner falls back before making the calls. For example, `max_data_go_kr_calls_per_day=1` is too small because the pilot needs at least one listed-item page and one stock-price page.

KRX remains explicit request-only for now:

```text
source_modes.krx = request_only
```

This means KRX is not silently pretending to be live data. Use `source_modes` in `run_log.json` before interpreting the brief.

## Output Files

For `YYYY-MM-DD`, live-lite writes:

```text
output/korea_live_lite/YYYY-MM-DD_candidates.json
output/korea_live_lite/YYYY-MM-DD_evidence.json
output/korea_live_lite/YYYY-MM-DD_brief.md
output/korea_live_lite/YYYY-MM-DD_run_log.json
```

`candidates.json` contains cheap-scan candidates:

```text
symbol, company_name, reason_codes, scores, recommended_next_layer
```

`evidence.json` contains parsed evidence records visible as of the run date.

`brief.md` contains the Korean monitoring brief.

`run_log.json` contains:

```text
missing credentials
source call counts
built request metadata
skipped candidates
skipped queries and reasons
dropped search results and reasons
run notes
```

Use `source_modes` before reading the brief. For example:

```text
source_modes.opendart = fixture
-> the brief came from fallback data, not actual OpenDART live data.

source_modes.opendart = live_executed
-> OpenDART date-range collection actually ran through the HTTP executor or cache.
```

## OpenDART Date-Based Collection

The runner intentionally avoids:

```text
2,500 listed companies * 1 disclosure search each
```

Bad:

```text
for each listed company:
    call OpenDART list.json
```

Good:

```text
call OpenDART list.json by bgn_de/end_de with pagination
group disclosures by stock_code/corp_code
scanner filters by symbol in memory
```

Instead:

```text
OpenDART list.json with bgn_de/end_de
-> all disclosures for the date window
-> local symbol filtering
```

This is the main reason live-lite can be operated safely before a full production scheduler exists.

OpenDART live execution uses paginated request metadata:

```text
bgn_de
end_de
page_no
page_count
```

Raw JSON is cached under:

```text
data/cache/opendart/YYYY-MM-DD/
```

Tests use mocked HTTP responses, not real network calls.

## Naver Search Live Execution

Naver Search live mode is explicit and credential-gated.

Required:

```text
NAVER_CLIENT_ID
NAVER_CLIENT_SECRET
```

The runner executes only budgeted candidate queries, not all-listed deep search. Raw JSON is cached under:

```text
data/cache/naver/YYYY-MM-DD/
```

The search result then flows through the existing ranking/fetch/parsing path:

```text
Naver Search JSON
-> SearchResult
-> fixture/manual text or fetchable text
-> NewsItem/ResearchReport/DisclosureEvent
-> Evidence
```

## Tiny Live Pilot

Start with a small live pilot:

```python
from datetime import date
from e2r.pipeline.korea_live_lite import KoreaLiveLiteBudget, KoreaLiveLiteConfig, KoreaLiveLiteRunner

result = KoreaLiveLiteRunner().run(
    KoreaLiveLiteConfig(
        as_of_date=date.today(),
        fixture_mode=False,
        live_enabled=True,
        universe_limit=100,
        budget=KoreaLiveLiteBudget(
            max_opendart_calls_per_day=20,
            max_krx_calls_per_day=100,
            max_data_go_kr_calls_per_day=100,
            max_naver_search_calls_per_day=30,
            max_symbols_for_event_search=10,
            max_symbols_for_deep_research=3,
        ),
    )
)

print(result.run_log_path)
```

Then inspect:

```text
missing_credentials
source_modes
live_requests_executed
fallback_reasons
request_only_sources
skipped_queries
dropped_search_results
```

## Search Escalation

Reason codes become targeted queries.

Example:

```text
DISC_SUPPLY_CONTRACT
-> {company} 장기공급계약 매출액 대비
-> {company} 단일판매 공급계약 계약기간
-> {company} 수주잔고
```

Risk-only candidates are not escalated.

Example:

```text
거래정지 + 관리종목
-> recommended_next_layer = none
-> web research skipped
```

## Stage 3-Green Evidence Rule

Live-lite mode requires at least two independent evidence types for Stage 3-Green unless explicitly disabled.

Counts as independent evidence types:

```text
disclosure
research_report
news
financial_actual
consensus
consensus_revision
```

Simple example:

```text
broker report only
-> can be Stage 3-Yellow

OpenDART disclosure + broker report
-> can be Stage 3-Green if deterministic scoring also passes
```

Disable only for controlled experiments:

```python
KoreaLiveLiteConfig(
    as_of_date=date.today(),
    require_cross_evidence_for_stage3_green=False,
)
```

## Safety Rules

Do:

- keep fixture mode as the default
- set small budgets for first live pilots
- review `run_log.json` after every run
- stop on CAPTCHA/blocking signals
- preserve `as_of_date`

Do not:

- deep-search every listed company
- scrape aggressively
- store API keys in code or output files
- invent missing contract fields
- use future data
- output buy/sell recommendation wording

## What Still Requires Paid Or Manual Data

Free live-lite mode does not replace:

- full licensed consensus history
- broker database coverage metadata
- complete analyst revision time series
- paid normalized financial databases
- proprietary sector aggregates

The intended use is early detection and monitoring:

```text
free official event
-> cheap candidate
-> targeted web research
-> evidence-backed E2R stage monitoring
```
